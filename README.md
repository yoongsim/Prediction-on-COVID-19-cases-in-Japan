# Prediction-on-COVID-19-cases-in-Japan
Prediction on the number of confirmed cases and death in Japan for the first quarter of 2023 using different univariate time series forecast models

## Time series forecast models used  
- Error Trend and Seasonality (ETS)  
- Trend and Seasonal components (TBATS)  
- Holt's Trend Method  
- Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)  


The models were then evaluated on the testing data using various evaluation metrics such as MAPE, RMSE, MSE, MAE and R Squared.  
The model that performs the best was then used to predict the daily new cases and new deaths from January until March 2023.
